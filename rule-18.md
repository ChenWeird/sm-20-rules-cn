##18. Provide sources

Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such as 2+2=4), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures differ depending on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources. Without SuperMemo, those discrepancies are often difficult to notice: before you encounter the new fact, the old one is often long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable. Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g. Watch out!, Other sources differ!, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked).

##原则十八：提供信息来源

除了已充分验证的知识(比如2+2=4)，建议你加上收集的知识素材的来源出处.在现实场景中经常会遇到对信息可信度的挑战,那这时信息的来源出处就能帮上忙.信息来源渠道不同, 事实和数据也会有差别；你可能会惊讶地发现,一家信誉良好的信息机构发布和其知名同行极其不同的数据.如果没有SuperMemo,这些差异往往难以被注意到：因为经常是遇到新事实之前，旧的信息已早被遗忘。有资料来源，就能据此更可靠地推测选择哪些信息是更为可信的。要进一步增加可信度，添加标签也十分有用(例如: “注意!” “有其他不同来源!”等).信息来源应该是伴随该知识条目，而非本身变成需要学习知识的一部分，除非它对你回忆起该知识十分关键.
