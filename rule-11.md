##11. Combat interference
When you learn about similar things you often confuse them. For example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words historic and historical. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes it harder to remember another item, we have a case of memory interference. You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until ... you memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either! For example, if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about the location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting. In simple terms: you will get confused about what is what.

Interference is probably the single greatest cause of forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when it strikes, and the only hermetic procedure against it is to detect and eliminate. In other words, in many cases it may be impossible to predict interference at the moment of formulating knowledge. Interference can also occur between remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and Guyenne, as well as Guyana, kayman and ... aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It very hard to predict.

Still you should do your best to prevent interference before it takes its toll. This will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable. Here are some tips:

- make items as unambiguous as possible
- stick to the minimum information principle (many of the remaining rules in this text are based on avoiding interference!)
- eliminate interference as soon as you spot it, i.e. before it becomes your obsession (e.g. as soon as you see the word inept you think "I know the meanings of inept and inapt but I will never know which is which!")

##原则十一：与干扰做斗争

当你学习相同的内容时你经常会混淆他们。比如：你可能在区分单词historic和historical时碰到问题。这种情况在你记忆大量数字时会更加明显，例如：在药剂学中药物的最佳剂量。
如果对一项内容的知识使记住另一项内容更加困难了，那么我们称这种情况为记忆干扰。
往往，你可以牢牢的记住某项内容好多年，直到。。。你开始记忆另一项内容，以至于两者都很难记住了！比如，你在学习地理的时候记住了位于委内瑞拉，苏里南和巴西之间的国家是圭亚那。而且，只要复习几次，你就能很容易的回忆起这个事实。然而，一旦你添加了相似的内容并询问所有这些国家以及法属圭亚那和哥伦比亚的位置时，你会突然发现很强的记忆干扰并开始遗忘，简单来说就是，你会混淆，而不知道哪个是哪个了。

对于有经验的SM用户来说，记忆干扰可能是遗忘的最大的一个原因。你永远无法知道它什么时候会发生，应对他的唯一方法就是发现并去除。换而言之，在组织知识点时预测记忆干扰往往是不可能的。干扰可能发生在毫不相干的内容之间，象是Guyana, Guyard, Guyenne(形似？)以及Guyana, kayman and ... aspirin(什么鬼？) 对于你和别的人来说，记忆干扰的作用方式会很不同。这很难预测。

在记忆干扰产生不良影响前，你应该尽可能的防止这种情况。这有助于减少你学习过程的精神压力。下面是一些提示：

- 让问题尽可能的清晰。
- 谨遵最小信息原则。(本文剩余的诸多准则都是基于避免干扰的!)
- 在记忆干扰对你造成困惑之前，一旦发现，要立刻去除。(例如：当你看见单词inept，你想，我知道单词inept和inapt的意思，但我不要知道哪个是哪个)
