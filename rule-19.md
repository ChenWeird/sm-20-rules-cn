##19. Provide date stamping
Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge, personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time stamping or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you might stamp them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is enough you stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can update your items. Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize knowledge that became outdated. Date stamping is useful in editing and verifying your knowledge; however, you will rarely want to memorize stamping itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP figures over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.

##原则十九：提供时间戳标记

有的知识体系如基础数学,解剖学,分类学和自然地理是相对稳定的;而经济指数,高新技术,个人数据等则信息则富于变化. 所以提供时间戳标记或者表明信息过期程度的标签变得十分重要. 处理统计数据时,你可以用收集年份给数据”盖戳”；学习软件应用时,按照软件版本标记就足够.有了新数据后,你可以更新相关的项目.不幸的是,在大多数情况下你都不得不重新记一遍早已过时的知识; 然你几乎不会想要记住时间戳标记本身.如果你想记住在既定时间内某一特定数据的变化(比如不同年份的国民生产总值),时间戳标记此时本身就成为需要学习的知识.
