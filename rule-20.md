##20.Prioritize

You will always face far more knowledge that you will be able to master. That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality knowledge in the long-term. The way you prioritize will affect the way your knowledge slots in. This will also affect the speed of learning (e.g. see: learn basics first). There are many stages at which prioritizing will take place; only few are relevant to knowledge representation, but all are important:

1. Prioritizing sources - there will always be a number of sources of your knowledge. If you are still at student years: these will most likely be books and notes pertaining to different subjects. Otherwise you will probably rely more on journals, Internet, TV, newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. It is always worth being aware what is the optimum proportion of time devoted to those varied sources. As you progress with learning, you will quickly develop a good sense of which learning slots bring better results and which might be extended at the cost of others

2. Extracting knowledge - unless you are about to pass an important exam, it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole articles. You will need to extract those parts that are most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge. You can do it by (1) marking paragraphs in a book or journal, (2) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo, (3) pasting relevant passages to SuperMemo, (4) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo notes, etc. You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge you can indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you can feasibly master. Your best way to prioritize the flow of knowledge into your memory is to use incremental reading tools

3. Transferring knowledge to SuperMemo - you may try to stick with the 20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing your material to SuperMemo. However, you can also literally transfer your notes or import whole files and later use the mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of processing the imported material. Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or items. If formulation requires more knowledge, more time, comparing with other sources, etc. you can just import. Otherwise, if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a matter of seconds, formulate it

4. Formulating items - make sure that explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that your attention is focused on the most important part of the item. The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context

5. Using forgetting index - you can use the forgetting index to prioritize pending items. The sequence of repetitions will naturally be determined by SuperMemo; however, you can request higher retention level for items that are more important and lower retention level for items of lower priority

6. Learning - the process of prioritizing does not end with the onset of repetitions. Here are the tools you can use to continue setting your priorities while the learning process is under way:
- Remember (Ctrl+M) - re-memorize items of high priority that have changed or which are extremely important to your knowledge at a given moment. If you choose Ctrl+M you will be able to determine the next interval for the currently reviewed item (its repetition counter will be reset to zero). It is recommended that you always re-memorize items whose content has changed significantly
- Reschedule (Ctrl+J) - manually schedule the date of the next repetition
- Execute repetition (Ctrl+Shift+R) - manually execute a repetition even before the repetition's due date (e.g. when reviewing particularly important material)
- Forget (Ctrl+R) - remove the current item from the learning process and place it at the end of the pending queue
- Dismiss (Ctrl+D) - ignore the current item in the learning process altogether
- Delete (Ctrl+Shift+Del) - remove the current item from your collection
- Change the forgetting index of memorized items or change the ordinal of pending items (Ctrl+Shift+P)

##原则二十：确定优先顺序

你将经常面临有知识太多没法完全掌握的问题。因此长远来说确定优先顺序对于建立有效知识十分关键。如何确定优先顺序将会影响到你的知识储备方式以及学习速度(参照 “learn basics first”部分). 许多阶段都会要确定优先顺序;极少数是和”知识展示”相关,但全部都很重要:

1. 优先信息来源- 你的知识素材来源经常不止一个. 如果你尚在求学,信息来源最有可能是不同学科的书籍和笔记. 其他则可能是依靠期刊,网络,电视,报纸,百科全书,词典等信息来源. 

2. 提取知识-记忆整本书籍或者文章几近不甚明智,除非有重要考试需要背考.你需要提取的是最可能影响知识信息质量的部分. 可以通过如下方式做到: 1.标记书籍或者期刊的段落; 2. 将相关网页复制到SuperMemo; 3.将相关文章段落复制到SuperMemo; 4. 将事实和数据直接添加到SuperMemo的笔记中. 你需要有一定的经验积累，才能正确衡量大脑能够接收的知识量以及你实际能掌握的细节精准度.而借助增量阅读工具是将知识流纳入记忆的最佳方式.

3. 将知识转移至SuperMemo.你可以在SuperMomo添加素材阶段起运用SuperMemo组织知识的20条规则.然也可以直接将笔记或者完整的文件直接先添加进SuperMemo,然后再用SuperMemo提供的机制决定导入材料的处理顺序.决定是直接原样导入还是先组织优化的最好标尺是看精确组织导入材料的需要耗时. 如果组织知识需要耗费更多的信息和时间,那就直接导入材料; 如果正确组织一个类项只需数秒,那就先组织好再导入.

4. 组织信息条目-确保答案的解释或者补充内容放进括号里,这样你的注意力就集中在最重要的条目部分. 可以在结合上下文重复增强记忆时阅读括号里的内容.

5. 运用遗忘指数-你可以使用遗忘指数优先排列待复习的内容条目. SuperMemo默认设定了重复记忆的顺序,但是你可以分别调高更为重要内容、降低低优先级别内容的识记率.

6. 学习-设置优先级别的过程并不是开始重复记忆阶段了就此结束.你可以用以下工具在学习进程中继续设置优先级别:

- Ctrl+M         记忆-在给定时间内重新记一遍对知识架构特别重要的或者发生改  变的高优先级别条目项.如果你选择使用Ctrl+M,可以改变正在复习的内容下次何时出现(之前的重复计数将会清零).建议要经常重新学习内容有极大变化的相关条目项.
- Ctrl+L         重设-手动设置下次重复的日期.
- Ctrl+Shift+R   执行复习-手动提前复习还没有到期的内容(例如需要重温特别重要的材料)
- Ctrl+R         后置遗忘-将条目项从当前学习内容移除并移动到等待学习队列末尾.
- Ctrl+D         忽略-直接在学习进程中忽略当前条目项.
- Ctrl+Shift+Del 删除-从文件夹中删除当前条目项.
- Ctrl+Shift+P   改变已背条目项的遗忘指数或者排队条目项的序列.
